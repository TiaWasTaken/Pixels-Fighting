# Pixels-Fighting
"Pixels Fighting" is a Python-based visual simulation that uses the Pygame library to create a dynamic grid where each cell (box) can be either "alive" or "dead". The user can choose to input custom colors for the "alive" and "dead" states using HEX values or let the program assign random colors.
